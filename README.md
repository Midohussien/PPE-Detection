# PPE-Detection
The goal of this machine learning project is to develop a computer vision system that can accurately detect Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) on workers in various industrial settings. This system will help ensure the safety of workers by identifying whether they are wearing the required PPE, such as helmets, gloves, safety vests, in real-time.
